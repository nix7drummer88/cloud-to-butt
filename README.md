hack-to-password-get
=============

![](logo.png)

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'hacking' with 'password getting'. Inspired by the popular cloud-to-butt extensions.

Sometimes there are real hacks in the world, but far too often what the media calls a 'hack' is more of a 'got their password' through social engineering or other means. This extension aims to poke fun at this.
